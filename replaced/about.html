      <h1>Have you ever wondered what is your place as a human being in our age?</h1>
      <p>As the world is shifting from analog to digital technology at a faster pace, we find ourselves being easily
        replaceable by <span class="name-walter" onmouseover="onWalterHover()"
          onmouseout="onWalterOut()">automation</span> or machines. Although digital and automatic process includes
        endless benefits and possibilities, the thought of being somehow equal to the machine is terrifying. “Replaced”
        is
        a project that aims to show how we as humans are essential. The project questions what is exactly the role of
        the
        human being in the creative process and why is it so difficult and almost impossible to relinquish us of it.
        However, replaced generator might surprise you with its capabilities. By teaching the program’s algorithm
        replaced
        generator can mimic the <span class="name-walter" onmouseover="onHumanHover()"
        onmouseout="onHumanOut()">human behavior</span> when drawing while listening to music. This process is called graphic
        notation to be more professional. To create graphic scores all you need to do is draw the notes and sounds you
        hear as you feel them.

        <h2>Automation</h2>
        <p class="test">Automation describes a wide range of technologies that reduce human intervention in processes.
          Human intervention is reduced by predetermining decision criteria, subprocess relationships, and related
          actions
          — and embodying those predeterminations in machines.</p>

        <h2>Human Behavior</h2>
        <p class="test">Behavior is also driven, in part, by thoughts and feelings, which provide insight into individual psyche, revealing such things as attitudes and values. Human behavior is shaped by psychological traits, as personality types vary from person to person, producing different actions and behavior.</p>
